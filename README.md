**How To Contribute / Collaborate**



1. Use your favorite Git client to clone this repo to a preferred location (not in your `SimHub `folder).

2. Hard link the folder containing the dash itself to the SimHub directory so you can make changes and use them, while also having `git` able to see the files and their changes (example from my machine):
   
   > mklink /J "C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\DashTemplates\DahlDesignDDU" "c:\Users\Matt Cowger\Desktop\DahlDesignDashDev\DahlDesignDDUDev"

3. 
   Do your thing and send in PRs!
